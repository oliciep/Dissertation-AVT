# Dissertation Project - AVT Architecture

This project is designed around the improvement and developmenet of the AVT architecture. I have tweaked the original architecture to increase efficiency. In addition, I carried out a number of experiments to foresee potential future research within the field of computer vision.


## Features

- Tweaking AVT loss function to monitor efficiency at certain times.
- Anticipation time experiments to pinpoint regression of model.
- Decoder Layer experiments to improve efficiency.
- Attention heads experiments to improve efficiency.
- Backbone modifications to try improve efficiency.
